excel trying to solve a sudoku puzzel


this is me and excel trying our best.

this isnt the finnal version, still working on it.
First of all, this excel was made in the french version of ofice excel, and the its the 2016 version.

  # how it work
  
1 - its look for the messing numbers in the 3*3 grid
2 - looks for the messing number in the entire 1*9 row
3 - it looks for the messing numbres in the entire 9*1 colume
4 - when a all the above are are met up, the cell will take a numbre that meet all the requerments
5 - move to the next step, ( just repeate the above )
6 - repete for 20 times, ( there is no resone why 20 steps, beside to make sure its will give the best results)

NOTE :  - some times it will not get the results correct, some cell may swap the numbres, and some times its just wont work good.
        - the other 2 python files are to verify or generate the puzzel



best of luck.
